College Examination Management System (CEMS)
The College Examination Management System (CEMS) is a comprehensive information system meticulously crafted to centralize and enhance the efficiency of administering tests within the college ecosystem. Tailored for the convenience of Lecturers, Head of Departments, and students, CEMS is built on a robust SQL database infrastructure, facilitating seamless server-client connections. The primary objective of this system is to streamline the entire test management process, encompassing test creation, performance tracking, grading, 
and statistical analysis. With a user-friendly interface, CEMS aims to elevate the testing experience for all stakeholders involved in the academic assessment process.

# Core Logic & GUI:
Implemented in Java with JavaFX for the graphical interface.
FXML structures content, CSS for custom styles, and controllers connect FXML to JavaFX.
